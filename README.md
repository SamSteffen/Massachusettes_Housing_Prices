# Overview
## What We're Trying To Solve
Zillow's 'zestimator' is a well-known and widely-used machine learning algorithm that predicts house price for site-users based on a variety of features. This project is an attempt to create a home price estimator similar to the one used by Zillow, to predict housing prices based on regional features specific to geographical zip code. Below we have documented the creation of a multivariate linear regression machine learning model that draws on known sale prices of homes in Portland, OR to predict future sale prices based on number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, lot size, whether the house has a garage, the year the house was built, school ranking and median income for each zip code.

## Tools and Communication Protocols
To analyze and prepare our data for our machine learning model, we plan to use the following tools:
- **Excel** - Most of our data will be downloaded from an online source in csv format, from which it will be imported to a jupyter notebook for initial cleaning
- **Python** - Using Python's pandas library, we will create dataframes from our dataset and prepare it for importing to our SQL database.
- **PostgreSQL** - We will use SQL to merge multiple datasets into a single database.
- **Tableau** - We will use Tableau Public to create visualizations of cleaned, merged data, taken from our PostgreSQL database. 
- **GitHub** - GitHub will host our repository.   

To effectively communicate as a team, the following tools will be utilized:   
- **Slack** - This is a messaging platform that will allow our team to communicate quickly and effectively about tasks.
- **Zoom** - This is a virtual videoconferencing software that will help us conduct group meetings.
- **Email** - Email will be used to share data files and additional side-bar messages, as well as collaborate on our GoogleSlides.

## Strategy and Metrics
The goals of this analysis include:
- Utilize recent housing data to reflect current market trends.
- Develop a machine learning model capable of predicting home sale price (target variable) using number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, lot size, whether the house has a garage, the year the house was built, school ranking, and median household income by zipcode, with an accuracy score of 60% or higher.

## Data Artifacts
Data products this project will produce include:
- Visualizations of housing price, average interest rate, average income over a given time period, within a specified location, available on a shareable storyboard (Tableau Public).
- Accuracy score summary reports.
- Evidence of our discovered insights will be available in the summary section of this README.

# Procedure
## Preprocessing and Initial Findings:
>Dataset 1: Portland Housing Data
- Our first dataset was downloaded from Kaggle.com, containing information pertaining to the housing market, regional to Portland, Oregon. The initial dimensions included 348 columns and more than 25,000 unique rows of data.

After pairing the columns down from 348 to 21, we were yielded 21,168 rows of usable data that provided housing prices and Zillow estimates for homes in Portland and the surrounding area, between the dates of June 12, 2020 to July 15, 2021.

![df_image](https://github.com/SamSteffen/Portland_Housing_Prices/blob/main/Deliverable%201/images/df.jpg)

The final features of this cleaned dataset include:    
    - Address (abbreviated)       
    - City    
    - Zipcode    
    - Latitude coordinates    
    - Longitude coordinates   
    - Number of bathrooms   
    - Number of bedrooms   
    - Lot size   
    - Garage (True or False indicates whether a garage is present or not)   
    - School_rating_0* (Elementary school rankings, 1-10 scale)   
    - School_rating_1* (Middle school rankings, 1-10 scale)   
    - School_rating_2* (High school rankings, 1-10 scale)   
    - Year Built   
    - Days on Zillow   
    - Date Sold    
    - Price (what the house actually sold for, US dollar amount)    
    - Zestimate (what Zillow predicted the house would sell for, US dollar amount)
    - Rent Zestimate (what Zillow predicted the house could be rented for, US dollar amount)    
    - Property tax rate    
    - Tax assessed value (what the value is deemed worth according to the taxing authorities)    
    - Tax assessed year    

\* School ranking data for this dataset is taken from https://www.greatschools.org/.

Further exploration of this dataset showed that there were 62 unique zip codes present, with value counts ranging from 1 to 1,001 per zipcode. To make sure our data was more evenly distributed from the outset, we filtered this data to return only data for zip codes that included more than 500 rows of data. This left us with 15 unique zip codes, and 10,356 rows of data.

>Dataset 2: Combined Income, Census, and Zipcode Data
- Our second dataset was compiled from zipatlas.com, census.gov and google.com/maps websites. These sources were combined to generate a dataset of median household income for zipcodes that were available in our first dataset.

![median_incomes_csv](https://github.com/SamSteffen/Portland_Housing_Prices/blob/main/Deliverable%201/images/median_income_by_zip.jpg)


## Transforming and Loading the Data into the Database (PostgreSQL)
Once the raw data was compiled, it was cleaned using Python's pandas library (in a Jupyter notebook) and loaded into PostgreSQL where it was joined together using the Portland zipcodes in the first dataset as the primary key to retrieve and append the median household income from the second. The image below depicts the entity relationship diagram (ERD) of the data:

![ERD_image](https://github.com/SamSteffen/Portland_Housing_Prices/blob/main/Deliverable%203/images/updated_database_schema.png)

The datasets were merged using a left join to generate a new table that contained the target variable (housing prices) and the independent variables (number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, lot size, garage, year built, school rankings and median household income). The image below depicts this SQL join query:

## Multivariate Linear Regression Machine Learning Model

Multivariate Regression is an extension of simple linear regression. It is used when we want to predict the value of a variable based on the value of two or more different variables. The variable we want to predict is housing price, which is the dependent variable and the target in our model. The independent variables that we used to calculate the target are features that we predict will influence house prices in the Portland, OR market, and utimately can be transferred to other markets.


  * **Input Data** - A connection string was used to access the SQL database (Portland_Housing_Prices) and import the merged table into Jupyter Notebook. See code below.

## Exploratory Analysis and Feature Selection
After linking to the database and bringing in the merged table, a dataframe was built that included all of the possible features. The following columns were immediately dropped because it was determined that they provided no value to this analysis: unnamed:0, abbreviatedaddress, city, latitude, longtitude, date_sold, zestimate. 

![Feature Selection](https://github.com/SamSteffen/Portland_Housing_Prices/blob/main/Robin_Updated_Images/Updated_FeatureSelection_ML.png)

**Drop Columns** - The merged_table_df consisted of 18 columns. The following columns were immediately dropped because it was determined that they provided no value to our model: 
abbreviatedaddress, city, latitude, longtitude, date_sold, zestimate.

After deciding on zip code, bathrooms, bedrooms, price, date_sold, median_income and lotsize as our initial features, we ran descriptive statistics on the dataframe.

![DescriptiveStats_Features1 NEED TO UPDATE IMAGE WITH NEW FEATURE](https://github.com/SamSteffen/Portland_Housing_Prices/blob/main/Robin_Updated_Images/Updated_DescriptiveStats_ML.png)

**Feature Selection** - After deciding upon the features: zipcode, # of bathrooms, # of bedroomms, garage (T/F), school_rating_0, school rating_1, school_rating_2, date_sold, ave_income, year_built and lotsize, we ran descriptive statistics on the new dataframe, House_FT_df. 
After a preliminary investigation of the newly created HouseFT_DF, it was determined that the bedrooms and bathrooms features both contained zeros for minimum values.  Since homes with zero bedrooms and/or bathrooms would probably not be valid data points we dropped the values records with zero values.

![DropZeros](https://github.com/SamSteffen/Portland_Housing_Prices/blob/main/Robin_Updated_Images/Updated_zerosdropped_ML.png)

**Drop Records with Zero Values** - After a preliminary investigation of the newly created HouseFT_DF, it was determined that the bedrooms, yearbuilt and bathrooms features all contained 
zeros for minimum values.  Since homes with zero bedrooms and/or bathrooms and zeros for yearbuilt would likely not be valid data points, we dropped the records with zero values.

## Preprocessing
**Handling Outliers and Skewness**
A standard scaler was applied to the House_FT dataframe to normalize the data across the independent variable columns.  

![ScaledData](https://github.com/SamSteffen/Portland_Housing_Prices/blob/main/Robin_Updated_Images/StandardScaler_ML.png)

Since zip codes are categorical data rather than continuous, Dummies Encoding was applied.

![ZipEncoding](https://github.com/SamSteffen/Portland_Housing_Prices/blob/main/Robin_Updated_Images/DummiesEncoding_ML.png)

It was determined that both lotsize and price had skewed distributions. See below.  Dropped lotsize < 20000000 , Dropped price < 25000000

## Problems and Adjustments to the Model
- Ran the model without scaling data, got the same exact r score.
- Ran a model with encoded zip codes and no lat/long, and no scaled data and got an r score of 46.
- Using the get dummies or hot one encoding isn't going to work for lat/long because we'll get a column for individual occurrences of them, so that would be thousands of columns.
- Our data for price, bed, bath, and lot size is heavily skewed so this could be a reason the model's performance is low.
- Created a random forest regression model with PCA, got a .561 r score, Spearman correlation of .75, and Pearson correlation of .75.

## Model Building
Split into target and features, split into test and train set using the standard 75/25 split.

# Results
- From the 3 models tested the Linear Regression model from the sklearn module resulted in the highest r2 value.   
- 4,401 records were tested from 7 different zip codes in Portland, OR.   
- 9 individual features were selected for testing:   
   - Number of bathrooms   
   - Number of bedrooms   
   - Lot size   
   - Garage   
   - Year Built   
   - Elementary School Rating   
   - Middle School Rating   
   - High School Rating   
   - Median Income (by zip code)   
> The top 3 features that impacted the sale price of homes were:   
> - Number of bedrooms (.56 r)
> - Number of bathrooms (.48 r)
> - Elementary school rating (.36 r)

> The features with least correlation to the sale price of homes were:
> - ZIP code 97217
> - ZIP code 97222
> - ZIP code 97223

> The presence of a garage was the fourth-lowest ranking feature in home-price correlation. This is meaningful for individuals who may be thinking of adding a garage to their house or completing an enclosure to increase the sale price of their home; the return on investment may not be worth the trouble.

> The model worked, but demonstrated an R2 score of .511, indicating a moderate performance as far as the ability to accurately predict the price of a home in Portland, OR.
