# Overview
## What We're Trying To Solve
This repository documents the creation of a linear regression machine learning model that predicts housing prices in Portland, Oregon based on number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, lot size, zip code and median income for each zip code.

## Data Sources
The primary data for this project was taken from the following two sources:
- Portland_data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/threnjen/portland-housing-prices-sales-jul-2020-jul-2021?select=portland_housing.csv
- 

## Preprocessing and Initial Findings:
>Dataset 1: Portland Housing Data
- Our first dataset was downloaded from Kaggle.com, containing information pertaining to the housing market, regional to Portland, Oregon. 

After pairing it down from an initial 348 columns to 13, we were yielded 21,168 rows of usable data that provided housing prices and Zillow estimates for homes in Portland and the surrounding area, between the dates of June 12, 2020 to July 15, 2021.

The final features of this cleaned dataset include:
    - Address (abbreviated)
    - City
    - Zipcod
    - Latitutde coordinates
    - Longitude coordinates
    - Days on Zillow
    - Date Sold
    - Price (what the house actually sold for, US dollar amount)
    - Zestimate (what Zillow predicted the house would sell for, US dollar amount)
    - Rent Zestimate (what Zillow predicted the house could be rented for, US dollar amount)
    - Property tax rate
    - Tax assessed value (what the value is deemed worth according to the taxing authorities)
    - Tax assessed year

Further exploration of this dataset showed that there were 62 unique zip codes present, with value counts ranging from 1 to 1001 per zipcode. To make sure our data was more evenly distributed from the outset, we filtered this data to return only data for zip codes that included more than 500 rows of data. This left us with 17 unique zip codes, and 11,854 rows of data.

>Dataset 2: Census Income Data
- Our second dataset was taken from census.gov website.

## Transforming and Loading the Data into the Database (PostgreSQL)



## Strategy and Metrics
List some goals of your analysis, ideally in the form of testable hypothesis, or via well-defined success metrics. These can be tentative, and you don’t need to stick to them throughout your project. Again, since you haven’t done any exploratory analysis yet, you might assume that the data has structure that it doesn’t, and you might not have seen other interesting patterns in the data. But you should always approach the data with some expectations so that your efforts are focused.

## Tools
To analyze and prepare our data for our machine learning model, we plan to use the following tools:
- **Excel** - Most of our data will be downloaded from an online source in csv format, from which it will be imported to a jupyter notebook for initial cleaning
- **Python** - Using Python's pandas library, we will create dataframes from our dataset and prepare it for importing to our SQL database.
- **PostgreSQL** - We will use SQL to merge multiple datasets into a single database.
- **Tableau** - We will use Tableau Public to create visualizations of cleaned, merged data, taken from our PostgreSQL database. 
- **GitHub** - GitHub will host our repository.

## Data Artifacts
Data products this project will produce include:
- Visualizations of housing price, average interest rate, average income over a given time period, within a specified location, available on a shareable storyboard (Tableau Public).
- Confusion Matrix
- Accuracy Score
- Evidence of our discovered insights will be available in the summary section of this README.
